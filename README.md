Simple app to allow sharing tracks to spotify from various sources which have no spotify integrations.
Currently this only supports shazam (i know is some countries shazam has spotify integration but i couldn't get it to work for me)

Works by registering for the standard android share button and parses the text to extract the artist and track name, 
then it opens the spotify app (must be installed on the device) with the corresponding search.
